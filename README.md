# train_scheduler

This project allows the user to input train names, destinations, initial deparature times, and frequency and appends this information to a table. The code calculates the number of minutes away from the next train's arrival and adds that information to the table as well. All of the information is stored in a Firebase database, which ensures that the user can access their train's information at any time they want to.
